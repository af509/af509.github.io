					<p>Safety is our number one priority. To ensure their safety and the safety of 
					our other guests, each dog is given a two-part evaluation before being permitted 
					to join group play sessions. The pets who prefer alone time will receive customized
					individual play sessions so they can still get the most out of their stay.</p>
